<h2 align="center">Project-Description</h2>
Team Profile Generator is an application that will generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

```
- GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

- WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information

- THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input

- WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML

- THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address

- WHEN I click on the GitHub username

- THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab

- WHEN I start the application

- WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number

- THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team

- WHEN I select the engineer option

- THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
